🌱 About the Project

AMUR is a full-stack e-commerce application created to highlight and uplift the beauty of natural Afro-textured hair.
It features plant-based formulations and hair care rituals inspired by ancient African traditions, blending modern UI/UX with cultural heritage.

The project delivers a premium shopping experience with a minimalist, warm aesthetic centered on representation, wellness, and inclusivity.

🧡 The Story Behind AMUR

Growing up in France, representation for Afro hair was rare.
Straight hair dominated beauty standards, and like many, I was taught that my curls were something to “fix,” not cherish. Chemical treatments, straightening, and damaging routines were considered normal.

Everything changed when I discovered the emerging Afro hair community — French brands like Ethnicia, and international bloggers who openly shared natural routines, rituals, and love for their heritage.

For the first time, I learned:

how to care for my natural hair

why it behaved the way it did

and how beautiful curls, coils, and kinks truly are

✨ AMUR is a tribute to that rediscovery of identity, confidence, and cultural beauty.

It is built for everyone who wants:
